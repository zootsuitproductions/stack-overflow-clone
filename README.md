The individual and team project for this class are designed to mirror the experiences of a software engineer joining a new development team: you will be “onboarded” to our codebase, make several individual contributions, and then form a team to propose, develop and implement new features. The codebase that we’ll be developing on is a Fake Stack Overflow project (let’s call it HuskyFlow). You will get an opportunity to work with the starter code which provides basic skeleton for the app and then additional features will be proposed and implemented by you! All implementation will take place in the TypeScript programming language, using React for the user interface.

## Database Architecture

The schemas for the database are documented in the directory `server/models/schema`.
A class diagram for the schema definition is shown below:

## Running Stryker Mutation Testing

Mutation testing helps you measure the effectiveness of your tests by introducing small changes (mutations) to your code and checking if your tests catch them. To run mutation testing with Stryker, use the following command in `server/`:

```sh
npm run stryker
```

{ : .note } In case you face an "out of memory" error while running Stryker, use the following command to increase the memory allocation to 4GB for Node.js:

```sh
node --max-old-space-size=4096 ./node_modules/.bin/stryker run
```
